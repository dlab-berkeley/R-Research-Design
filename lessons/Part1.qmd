## Purpose

The purpose of this workshop is to provide an overview of the minimum necessary steps to set up a research design. By the end of the workshop, students should feel comfortable writing their own pre-analysis plans and simulating data.

A research design is a procedure for generating answers to questions. The better the design, the more confident we can be that our answers are the correct answers to the question.

To figure out if our design is good, we need to know what question we want to answer and how we are going to go about collecting the empirical information. This first part of the workshop lays out a framework to understand what makes a research design.

## What are the Elements of a Research Design

Blair *et al* (2019) define the **MIDA** Framework to characterize a research design. Under this framework, any empirical research design has four components.

### The Model (M)

The model is a theoretical causal model of how the world works. It represents what we as researchers think the relevant set of variables, both exogenous (outside of control) and endogenous (affected by the system) variables and the way they relate to each other.

### The Inquiry (I)

The inquiry is the question about the theoretical model. In an experiment, we are often interested in the average difference between two treatment groups. Most commonly, this is the treatment group and the control group.

Inquires can be descriptive, such as the mean of a population. They can also be causal, such as the average difference in one variable when another variable changes value from 0 to 1. Every inquiry operates on events generated by our model of the world. These include the units of interest, the outcomes we consider for each unit, the conditions under consideration, and how we plan to summarize the differences in outcomes.

## Some Questions to guide a Research Project

### Challenge 

The following section is our first *Challenge* of this workshop. It is meant to be as interactive as you, a participant here would like it to be. You can choose to share your answers with each other, or just work through by yourself. Each of the following questions provide a solid starting point for any research project. Each of them will have payoffs down the line, either for implementation, presentation, and evaluation. Starting with the simplest answers cuts away potential cruft that is unnecessary to our question.

**Question 1: What kind of project is this?**

Is it a descriptive research project? Is it a prediction project? Is it a project to learn about a causal relationship between two variables?

**Question 2: Why am I interested in this project?**

What speaks to me about the project? If it's a class project, how can I find personal enjoyment and meaning in the project? If it is for work, what benefit will I and potentially my employer see because of this work? If it is for an academic project, what will I learn that will change my view about how the world works?

**Question 3: What is the target estimand of interest?**

In one sentence, what is the specific target goal of this research? Often we can phrase this for causal analysis as "What is the effect of X on Y?"

Answering this question helps to answer the following question.

**Question 4: What would be my ideal target population if I could choose any target population?**

A target population helps determine our ideal experiment and sets up what limitations may exist when we take our project to actual data.

**Question 5: What is the most straightforward piece of evidence I could find to convince myself that I have identified something interesting?**

We will see how we can use an R package called `DeclareDesign` to help us iterate on these questions later in the workshop.

## Pre-Analysis Plans

A Pre-Analysis Plan (PAP) is a document that is written before research is conducted to specify as precisely as possible what the procedure for data analysis will be. If you plan to publish research in academic journals, especially an experiment of any kind, PAPs are now commonly required. A PAP does not have to be complicated. The website [AsPredicted](https://aspredicted.org/) has a great tool to make them as simple as possible. A screenshot of the tool input page is below:
