## Purpose  

The purpose of this workshop is to provide an overview of the minimum necessary steps to set up and run a data analysis. We will cover the basics under the idea of a random control trial and show when applicable how steps will be different if using an observational study.

By the end of the workshop, students should feel comfortable writing their own pre-analysis plans and simulating data.
